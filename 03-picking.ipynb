    "# Picking\n",
    "We touched a bit on this in earlier examples, but let's now dive a bit deeper into \"picking\". Picking is built into Matplotlib's architecture. Automatically, for any 'button_press_event', the `contains()` method for all artist objects (anything that is drawable on the canvas is an artist) is called for the given x/y locations. Each artist may define what their `contains()` method means, but the important thing is that if `contains()` returns True, then a 'pick_event' is emitted with a specialized event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "That event object has a reference to the `artist` object that passed the `contains()` test, along with other event information such as the x/y coordinates and such. If the artist is of a special type known as a Collection, then the event will also have a list of integer indexes, `ind`, that represents which components of the artist collection was near the mouse event.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will create the callable class `RowPrinter` that will take a `LineCollection` object from `plt.plot()`, a pandas dataframe, and a picker argument. Previously, we set the 'picker' argument in the call to `plt.plot()`, but it doesn't have to be done that way. The `RowPrinter` will connect itself to pick events, and will print out information about any lines that are close to the mouse click."
