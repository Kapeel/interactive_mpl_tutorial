    "## Typical Imports\n",

    "\n",
    "I have commented out `plt.ion()` because it is not needed in the jupyter notebooks, but it is needed if these example scripts are executed in ipython. Most of the time, you will not need this command, and it isn't even needed in general for interactive applications. All it does is allow access to the REPL for interactive plotting."

    "Matplotlib has its own simple event and callback system that underpins its entire interactive feature-set. It is backend-agnostic, so it doesn't matter if you are using Windows, Mac, Linux, Qt, GTK, etc! This is how Matplotlib can work on such a wide variety of platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any callback function should take a single \"event\" argument, which is just a simple python object. Based on the type of event that it is, it may have different attributes defined. This callback function is a useful debugging tool, as it displays information about the event object that it received.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also stores the event as a global variable as a way to carry state between calls. It doesn't do anything with that state, but we will see examples of that later."

    "## Canvases, Figures, and Axes\n",
    "There are several layers to Matplotlib. Many plots can go onto an Axes object, and several Axes objects can go onto a Figure object. That figure object works in conjunction with the \"figure manager\" (advanced topic) and the \"canvas\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The manager is responsible for the GUI window, the canvas object, and the navigation toolbar. The canvas object is the GUI widget upon which \"stuff\" is rendered. It also manages all of its events -- translating GUI events into Matplotlib events, and triggering callbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making the Connection\n",
    "Now we will load up some \"data\", create our figure and axes object, and plot that data. We will also supply a value of 5 to the optional \"picker\" argument. This tells Matplotlib that the line drawn by this command should respond to mouse events within 5 points of the line, emitting a 'pick_event'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let's attach the `event_printer` callback to mouse button press events. The `mpl_connect()` method returns an id object that can be used later to disconnect that callback function, if desired."
